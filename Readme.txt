This is the Vigen√®re Cipher program in Python. It is designed to encrypt English messages in Python.

Here are the steps to how to use it....

1) There is a text file called file.txt where you can type whatever messages that you wish. 

2) The program for encrypting messages is in the main.py file. It will ask you to type in 
a keyword to use to encrypt what was written in the file.txt text file. 

3) Once you've written down a password, the program will ask whether to encrypt or decrypt 
words in the file.txt text file. Enter e to encrypt and Enter d to decrypt. 

4) Once you've entered either e or d, the program will create the new_file.txt text file
with either the encrypted or decrypted text, depending on what was entered in the third
step. 

Important Note: 
-To decrypt, you must put the encrypted text in the file.txt text file and enter d 
when asked. Otherwise, there will be an error message and the program will terminate. 

Happy Encrypting and Happy Decrypting!
